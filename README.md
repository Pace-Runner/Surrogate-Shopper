Surrogate-Shopper

This is an Android mobile app I built using Android Studio. Itâ€™s designed to connect volunteers with people who need help (whether it's shopping, running errands, or providing general support). The goal was to create a simple and practical solution that encourages community assistance.

This app was developed as part of a university coursework project to explore how mobile technology can be used to solve real-world problems, especially in areas like community support and communication.

Just a quick note: since the app was developed specifically for Android, it can only be installed on Android devices. Also, it relies on a WITS-hosted server to connect to its database â€” which means the app will only function as long as that server remains up and running.

For a full walkthrough of how the app works, you can check out the video and PDF linked below. They cover everything in detail.
